- Get abstracts
- run through stemmer (see nltk stemming docs)
- remove repeats of words
- subtract (stemmed) top 100/300/1000 most common words (this should be left as a hyperparameter for tuning)
- should have list of N words remaining
- represent each abstract as an N-vector of 1's and 0's: 1 if a word occurs, 0 otherwise
- to get similarity, compute |X-Y| for abstracts X and Y. Low values of more similar.
- compute similarity with every other abstract, return 10 most similar.
